# CSCI-2910-P1
## This project is a backend implementation for the ShinraNet social media platform prototype. The backend is built using FastAPI and Python 3, and it interacts with a frontend built in .NET Blazor. The purpose of this API is to provide endpoints that handle the core functionality of ShinraNet, such as user management, posts, and interactions between users.
